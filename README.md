# civic-voices To-Do List REST API


This is a To-Do List REST API built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It allows users to create, retrieve, update, and delete tasks, adhering to best practices for REST API development.


## Live Deployment

The API is deployed and accessible at: [https://lostid.co.ke](https://lostid.co.ke)
Since I already had an ec2 instance and a spare domain not in use, I found it easier for you to access it. [THE FEATURES OF THE TO DO LIST HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH LOST ID]
I am running a caddy reverse proxy server in the instance

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Reactjs
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB(Atlas)
- **Hosting**: AWS EC2 Instance
  
## Best Practices
I am familiar with the separation logic of models controllers and routes, but with the application being relatively smaller, I found it more efficient to have everything in the index file.
