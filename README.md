# To-Do List REST API

This is a To-Do List REST API built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It allows users to create, retrieve, update, and delete tasks, adhering to best practices for REST API development.


## Live Deployment

The API is deployed and accessible at: [https://lostid.co.ke](https://lostid.co.ke)
Since I already had an ec2 instance and a spare domain not in use, I found it easier for you to access it. [THE FEATURES OF THE TO DO LIST HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH LOST ID]
